### Why this works better:  
1. **Clear title:** Uses "Splitter" instead of "pliter" for accuracy.  
2. **Concise description:** Explains the purpose in fewer words.  
3. **Structured formatting:** Bullet points and headings improve readability.  
4. **Example added:** Helps users visualize the bot’s functionality.  
5. **Grammar/spelling fixes:** Corrects "projectwill" → "project will", "splite" → "split".
